# Tcl Silent File Reading Error

This repository demonstrates a subtle error in Tcl file I/O.  The `read_file` procedure attempts to read a file; however, if the file doesn't exist, the error isn't explicitly handled. The script should gracefully handle the case where a file cannot be opened, preventing unexpected program termination.
